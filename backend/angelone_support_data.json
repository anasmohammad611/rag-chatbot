I got less money than what I placed an withdrawal order for? Your withdraw amount is converted to corresponding units while placing order at exchange. We calculate the units to be withdrawn based on current NAVs. Mutual fund NAVs (Net Asset Value) are updated every day after the market closes from Monday to Friday (All working days) For example, on June 3rd, you will see the NAV for June 2nd. Consider the following scenario for withdraw order placed on June 3rd: If NAV on 3rd June > 2nd June, You will receive an amount greater than order amount. If NAV on 3rd June < 2nd June, You will receive an amount lesser than order amount. In Summary, you will receive an amount according to latest NAV. Will my next instalment be auto-debited? Your next SIP instalment will be Auto-Debited from your bank account if you have a valid Auto-pay setup. If not please setup an Autopay so that your future SIP instalments can be automated. To setup an Autopay, Please click below: {Setup Autopay} What is Stamp duty? The government collects 0. 005% of the overall purchase amount of any mutual fund scheme as stamp duty. So even if entire amount is debited from your bank account, 0. 005 percent of total amount is deducted and hence when order is completed, Same is reflected as invested amount. ?

IPO IPO OFS Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB) Stock SIP Where can I find my UPI ID? Generally, you can find your UPI ID in the profile section of the respective app you are using. Can I apply for an IPO? In case you don’t have a UPI ID, you can create it with any of the UPI Handles featured in the NPCI list. Alternatively, you can apply through ASBA with your bank or through physical form. How can I create my UPI ID? You can follow the below steps to create a UPI ID with the BHIM app Download the Google Pay/ PhonePe / BHIM App Verify your mobile number Register the passcode (it is required to open the app) Select your bank from the options available The app will fetch your bank details In case you have more than one account, choose the account you want to register with BHIM Set up a UPI PIN for security Now you can check your UPI ID in the profile section. Why am I unable to apply for IPOs via my UPI ID/Handle? For IPO applications, only UPI ID/Handles approved by NPCI are allowed. In case you are unable to apply for IPO using your UPI ID/Handle, we recommend that you check the list of banks/apps approved by NPCI for providing UPI service for IPO application. Why can’t I see my UPI handle listed in the dropdown in the Angel One app while applying for an IPO? In case you can’t find your UPI Handle in the dropdown list on the IPO page in the Angel One app, it means your UPI Handle is not approved by NPCI for applying for an IPO. Try to use or create an alternative UPI ID with any of the entities featured on the NPCI list. When will I receive my UPI mandate request after placing an order? Below are a few things you can do: Go to your Payment App – Navigate to the mandate section and check if you have an open mandate or not. In case you have received many mandates then you can cross verify with the Application ID mentioned in the mandate details with the Application ID mentioned in the order details from Angel One’s Application OR Make sure your Payments App is updated. OR If it is taking longer than 6 hours then cancel your bid from Angel one’s application and place a new bid. How to approve an IPO mandate request? You have to approve the IPO mandate request in your UPI app. By when can I approve the UPI mandate request? Pending mandates shall expire after 5 PM on the last day. So users should accept the mandate before 5 PM on the last day to participate in the IPO. What are the charges of applying for an IPO? With Angel One, there are no charges to apply for an IPO. How can an NRI apply for an IPO using the Angel One app? NRI’s can not apply via the Angel One app. However, they can apply through the physical ASBA (Application Supported By Blocked Amount) process with your bank. What is the cut-off price & why should I apply at a cut-off price? Cut-off price is the price at which the shares get issued through an IPO to the investors. This price is ascertained at the allotment stage. When an investor applies for an IPO at a cut-off price, that means he is ready to bid at this price. In an ideal scenario, all retail investors bid at the cut-off price to increase their chance of allotment. Can I use a bank account not linked with Angel One to apply? You can apply for an IPO using any other bank account provided the account is in the name of the investor. Can I apply for an IPO using my bank’s current account? It is preferred that you apply using your savings account as most banks do not process IPO applications submitted using a current account. You need to check with your bank for more details. Can I apply for an IPO using my HUF’s account? You cannot apply via the Angel One app. However, you can apply using your HUF account through the physical ASBA process with your bank. Can I apply for an IPO using her account? The Angel One app doesn’t allow a minor to apply. Although, a minor can apply via physical ASBA process through your bank. Why didn’t my account get debited after applying for an IPO? As per the ASBA process, banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO. Once the shares are allotted to you, the amount will be debited from your bank account. If the shares are not allotted to you, the amount will be unblocked/released to your account on/before the UPI mandate expiry date. Note: Banks usually take 10-15 days to release your funds. If your funds are still blocked after 15 days please contact your bank. Can I modify my IPO bid? Yes, you can modify the lot size and UPI ID of your IPO bid after placing an order. Please note that if you have approved your UPI mandate request for the order and modified the order later, the entire IPO bid amount will be blocked in addition to the amount blocked for your original IPO bid. You will also receive another UPI mandate request for your modified bid. However, if you haven’t approved the original mandate request, no amount will be blocked for the original IPO bid. Why is my IPO application rejected? Few of the common reasons your IPO application is rejected You might have entered the wrong UPI ID or UPI PIN while approving the mandate Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill’s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack’s application will be rejected because Jill’s bank account used is not linked to the demat account of Jack Jill’s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack’s PAN When will my funds be blocked and unblocked? Your funds will be blocked once you approve the UPI mandate request for IPO. Your funds will be unblocked/released on or before the UPI mandate expiry date if the shares are not allotted through IPO. Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked/released post the mandate expiry date. How can I get a guaranteed IPO allotment? We would like to explain that Angel One is merely a platform to apply for IPO and has no control over its allotment. IPO allotment can never be guaranteed since, in case of over-subscription, the allotment is done via a lottery system. However, you can avoid application rejection by Applying from only 1 Demat account per PAN Applying at cut-off price Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill’s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack’s application will be rejected because Jill’s bank A/C used is not linked to the Demat A/c of Jack Jill’s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack’s PAN Where can I check my refund status in case of a rejected/non-allotted IPO application? Banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO. So, your funds will be released/unblocked on or before the UPI mandate expiry date. Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked or released post the mentioned date. Why didn’t I get my IPO allotment? Common reasons why you didn’t get the allotment are Non-Allotment – Allotment is done through lottery system because of over-subscription Rejection – Application can be rejected due to either of the following reasons: 1) Application received from multiple Demat accounts having the same PAN 2) Bank account Demat account, and UPI ID used for an application not mapped to the same PAN 3) Your bid price is lower than the final issue price Is tax applicable on profit from an IPO? Tax will be levied on your profit as per your tax bracket. When is the next IPO coming? Visit our website https://www. in/upcoming-IPO to get all information about forthcoming IPO’s. I have approved the mandate request, but the status on the Angel One app is still pending. What to do? Your UPI mandate request status on the Angel One app does not get updated in real-time. It will reflect shortly in your IPO order book. Can I withdraw/delete/cancel my IPO bid? For an IPO application process in the Angel One app, withdrawing, deleting, and canceling the application is the same thing. Follow the below path to withdraw/cancel your IPO application Tap on IPO on the Home page Click on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order you wish to cancel Tap on cancel & confirm to cancel your IPO Order How can I check my IPO application status? Follow the below path to check your IPO application status Tap on IPO on the Home page Click on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order for which you want to check the application status Your IPO application status will be visible from here Where to check the IPO allotment status? Follow the below path to check your subscription status Tap on IPO on the Home page Click on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order for which you want to check the subscription status Your IPO subscription status will be visible from here Can I submit multiple applications for an IPO? Only 1 application per PAN is recommended. Even if you apply via different platforms using the same PAN, your application will be rejected and you will not get the IPO allotment. However, you can increase the chances of IPO allotment by applying with different account linked to different PAN. For example, you can apply with your and your parents demat account separately. ?

Bonus Issue Bonus Issue Buyback Dividend Holdings/Portfolio Rights Issue Stock Split TPIN What is Bonus Issue? Bonus shares are additional shares given by the company to existing shareholders, free of cost, in proportion to the shares held by the shareholder. Who is eligible for bonus shares? Shareholders who own shares of the company on the record date set by the company are eligible for bonus shares. When will the Bonus shares be credited in my demat account? The bonus shares will get credited to your demat account 10-15 days after the record date. In case you do not receive the same post 15 days from the Record date you can check the status with the Registrar (RTA). You can find the details of the Registrar on the BSE India website by visiting the Corp Information section. Why has the average price of the stock reduced after receiving bonus shares? The buy price of bonus shares is zero, as they are credited at no cost. When the shares are credited to your account, the quantity of shares increases while the invested value remains unaffected. As a result, the average price of the stock reduces. Be assured that it is correctly calculated by Angel One. ? Connect with our support team.

Trading & Surveillance Trading & Surveillance Risk Management – ASM & GSM What is a surveillance measure? Market surveillance plays a key role in ensuring safety and integrity of the markets as it the process of prevention and investigation of abusive, manipulative or illegal trading practices in the securities markets. Surveillance Measure is an initative by the regulatory bodies and exchanges to protect traders and investors by monitoring price and volatility and detecting misleading activities like insider trading, fictitious transactions, and more. What is ASM? SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) along with the stock exchanges have initiated an Additional Surveillance Measure or ASM to safeguard investors’ interests by ensuring there are no market speculations or manipulations like unexpected price movements. The stocks are categorized under ASM for surveillance based on criteria specified by NSE here. What is GSM? GSM or Graded Surveillance Measure is a system used by Indian Stock Exchanges like NSE and BSE to alert traders/investors and ask them to be extra cautious while dealing in certain securities which have been categorized under GSM.

Verifying your mobile number helps us create a secure account for you, ensuring a smooth app experience and the safety of your account. Can I continue if the mobile number linked to my bank is different from the one registered with the app? No, your details, including your mobile number, must match those verified by our banking partner. A mismatch will result in your application being rejected by the bank. Why are permissions to send SMS and access phone state required? These permissions are needed to verify your mobile number by sending an SMS. Rest assured, these permissions are used solely for verification purposes. Can I link any SIM for FD purchase if I have a dual SIM phone? Yes, you can. However, we recommend using the SIM registered with your bank account for authentication. Can I retry the registration if it was not successful earlier? Yes, you can retry. Ensure you use the SIM linked to your bank account for authentication. Can I invest in FD if I do not have a PAN? No, currently, we only process fixed deposit requests for individuals with an active PAN. Why is my PAN not getting verified? For booking fixed deposits, we need to verify your PAN with the regulated authorities. If there is a mismatch, the booking cannot be completed. What should I do if the name shown against my PAN is incorrect and I can't update it? The name linked to your PAN should be accurate for successful identity verification and KYC purposes. Please update your name to match your PAN. Why is my Aadhar required? Aadhar is mandatory for identification and KYC setup for your account, necessary for processing your FD request. Do I need a physical copy of my Aadhar? No, a physical copy is not required. We use secure platforms like DigiLocker and CKYC for verifying your Aadhar and other documents. What is DigiLocker? DigiLocker is a government initiative under the Digital India project for storing and verifying documents like PAN card, driving license, Aadhar card, school marksheets, and insurance papers. What should I do if there's a name mismatch and I can't complete the step? For successful FD booking, the name on your Aadhar and PAN should match. Correct the details on either your PAN or Aadhar card and retry. How can I add a new address as my current address? Use the “add” button on the address choice screen to add an address that is not listed. What should I do if I can't change my permanent address? The address from your Aadhar is considered your permanent address. You may add or select your current address to proceed with the FD application. Can my permanent address be the same as my current address? Yes, you can select your permanent address as your current address if they are the same. Why is video KYC required? Video KYC is required to complete the KYC verification step as mandated by the RBI. What if I am not available during bank working hours? If you have made the payment, we will notify you when the bank officers are available. If video KYC is not completed within 3 days, your money will be refunded to your bank account. When can I complete the Video KYC? Video KYC is available from Monday to Saturday, 09:00 AM to 08:00 PM. We will notify you to complete the video KYC during these hours if pending. What if video KYC fails? You can retry during banking hours within 2 days of FD booking if your video KYC fails. How will I know the status of my video KYC? Your video KYC details are verified by bank officers, which may take up to 3 hours. Track the video KYC and FD confirmation status on the ‘My Investments’ tab. What should I do if I can't move to the next step and complete my KYC verification? Retry using the correct details. If it still doesn’t work, try again later. If the issue persists, raise a ticket with our support team for assistance. Why are details related to occupation, income, and family required for FD booking? These details are required by the bank to create your fixed deposit and ensure communication if needed. Why is my money deducted before video KYC? Your money is deducted before video KYC as it is the last step to verify your identity and book your FD. Your money is safe with the bank, and interest starts accumulating from the time of payment. In case of issues with VKYC, your money will be refunded within 7 working days. What is required for completing a video KYC? Keep your PAN Card and a blank paper with a pen ready for the VKYC process. ? Connect with our support team.

You can save time using Basket Order as multiple orders are placed in one click. So, there is no need to place and execute individual orders. ? Connect with our support team.

Stop loss order Watchlist Basket Order Order Status Placing an Order Robo order Square Off Stop loss order Types of Orders Limit order Margin Calculator Options Order Rejection When I am trying to exit my position or place a Stop-Loss order, why is it being rejected? It may happen if you have a pending Stop-Loss (SL) or an exit order already. With an already pending stop-loss or exit order, you will need extra funds to be able to place a duplicate SL/exit order. If you do not have this extra fund in your account, then your duplicate exit order will get rejected. That’s why we inform you while exiting if there’s a Pending SL/exit order against a position, to avoid any duplicate orders and rejections. My Stop-Loss (SL) order was triggered but it did not get executed. Why did this happen? There could be 2 major reasons behind this: The asset may be lacking a buyer/seller at the defined stop-loss limit price due to a lack of market depth. Orders are queued while they are being purchased or sold. For example: Let’s say there are 50 buyers and 100 sellers who are waiting to trade on a scrip at ₹90. Upon reaching ₹90, the first 50 sellers’ orders will be executed, and the remaining 50 sellers will have to wait for new buyers. In case you are one of those remaining 50 sellers, your sell order will remain pending if there are no corresponding buyers and vice versa. The price movement during high volatility does not fulfill certain criteria e. suppose you have placed a sell stop-loss with trigger Price at ₹100 and limit price at ₹100. Now imagine that the LTP touched ₹100 (here, the SL would be triggered) and quickly went below ₹100 due to high volatility. The limit price of ₹100 means the stop-loss order would get executed at only ₹100 or more. Now this order will be pending as price is below Rs 100 and execution will happen only when price has reached or crossed Rs 100. Hence your stop-loss order was not executed. Due to this reason, we recommend keeping a sufficient gap between the trigger price and limit price to increase the chances of Stop Loss execution during high volatility. Note: In order to increase the chances of execution, we keep the default value of the limit price 2 ticks away from the trigger price. This is done so that if the LTP moves rapidly after triggering the order, the limit price shouldn’t be a hindrance and the order should still get executed. Also, if you change the pre-set limit price and bring it closer to the Trigger Price, the chances of execution can reduce in cases of volatility. My stop-loss order got triggered even though the predefined Trigger Price had not appeared. Why? Chances are that the market price did hit the stop-loss price, albeit momentarily and without you being able to spot it at that moment. Within a second, prices can change multiple times and not all of them are relayed to the Brokers by Exchange, especially during high volatility. As a result, such momentary price fluctuations are not seen anywhere. Price matching and execution of the orders is done by the Exchanges and not the Broker. What is Stop Loss? Stop-loss is a tool that investors use to minimise the loss in a trade. Some traders define it as an advance order, which triggers an automatic closure of an open position when the stock price reaches the trigger price level. Stop loss helps minimise losses but also limit profits from a trade. What is Trailing Stop Loss? A Trailing Stop-loss is an order that lets you set a maximum value or percentage of loss you can incur on a trade. If the securiy price rises or falls in your favour, the trigger price jumps with it at the set value or percentage. If the security price rises or falls against you, the trigger price stays in place depending on the nature of the order. How does a Stop-loss get triggered? Stop-loss can be your real saviour during a volatile market condition. A price level set at the beginning of the trade allows traders to close their position automatically when the stop-loss is reached. Squaring off takes place at the next price available at the trigger price level and helps limit losses. What is the 1% rule of trading? The 1% rule defines the maximum limit of risk one can take in a trade or the risk-per-trade. It implies adjusting your position so that total loss doesn’t cross 1% of your trade value when the stop-loss is triggered. The 1% rule helps avoid significant losses. Can I use stop-loss in trading with the AngelOne Trading app? You can place a Stop loss order in AngelOne mobile app by following the below simple steps: Visit the AngelOne app and select the stock to Buy/Sell Select quantity of the trade Set’ Trigger price’ Enter the price where you want to place stop-loss Confirm the stop-loss price, click on “Buy/Sell” and confirm the order ?

It does not guarantee that your order will be executed even if your price has been reached. Orders are queued while being bought or sold. Assume you placed a Buy limit order of 100 Rs for the ABC script. Let’s say there are 100 buyers and 50 sellers waiting to trade in ABC at 100. ABC is currently trading at 105 Rs and after a few minutes, it reaches 100 Rs. Since there are only 50 sellers for 100 Rs, only 50 buyers will be able to buy the script once this price is reached. As for the other 50 buyers, they’ll have to wait until more sellers become available. ? Connect with our support team.

यदि आपके पास वैध ऑटो-पे सेटअप है तो आपकी अगली एसआईपी किस्त आपके बैंक खाते से ऑटो-डेबिट हो जाएगी। यदि नहीं, तो कृपया एक ऑटोपे सेटअप करें ताकि आपकी भविष्य की एसआईपी किस्तें स्वचालित हो सकें। ऑटोपे सेटअप करने के लिए कृपया नीचे क्लिक करें: {सेटअप ऑटोपे} स्टाम्प ड्यूटी क्या है? सरकार किसी भी म्यूचुअल फंड योजना की कुल खरीद राशि का 0. 005% स्टांप शुल्क के रूप में एकत्र करती है। इसलिए भले ही आपके बैंक खाते से पूरी राशि डेबिट हो गई हो, कुल राशि का 0. 005 प्रतिशत काट लिया जाता है और इसलिए जब ऑर्डर पूरा हो जाता है, तो वही राशि निवेशित राशि के रूप में दिखाई देती है। ?

IPO IPO OFS Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB) Stock SIP Where can I find my UPI ID? Generally, you can find your UPI ID in the profile section of the respective app you are using. Can I apply for an IPO?

Why am I unable to apply for IPOs via my UPI ID/Handle? For IPO applications, only UPI ID/Handles approved by NPCI are allowed. In case you are unable to apply for IPO using your UPI ID/Handle, we recommend that you check the list of banks/apps approved by NPCI for providing UPI service for IPO application. Why can’t I see my UPI handle listed in the dropdown in the Angel One app while applying for an IPO? In case you can’t find your UPI Handle in the dropdown list on the IPO page in the Angel One app, it means your UPI Handle is not approved by NPCI for applying for an IPO. Try to use or create an alternative UPI ID with any of the entities featured on the NPCI list. When will I receive my UPI mandate request after placing an order? Below are a few things you can do: Go to your Payment App – Navigate to the mandate section and check if you have an open mandate or not. In case you have received many mandates then you can cross verify with the Application ID mentioned in the mandate details with the Application ID mentioned in the order details from Angel One’s Application OR Make sure your Payments App is updated. OR If it is taking longer than 6 hours then cancel your bid from Angel one’s application and place a new bid. How to approve an IPO mandate request? You have to approve the IPO mandate request in your UPI app. By when can I approve the UPI mandate request? Pending mandates shall expire after 5 PM on the last day. So users should accept the mandate before 5 PM on the last day to participate in the IPO. What are the charges of applying for an IPO? With Angel One, there are no charges to apply for an IPO. How can an NRI apply for an IPO using the Angel One app? NRI’s can not apply via the Angel One app. However, they can apply through the physical ASBA (Application Supported By Blocked Amount) process with your bank. What is the cut-off price & why should I apply at a cut-off price? Cut-off price is the price at which the shares get issued through an IPO to the investors. This price is ascertained at the allotment stage. When an investor applies for an IPO at a cut-off price, that means he is ready to bid at this price. In an ideal scenario, all retail investors bid at the cut-off price to increase their chance of allotment. Can I use a bank account not linked with Angel One to apply? You can apply for an IPO using any other bank account provided the account is in the name of the investor. Can I apply for an IPO using my bank’s current account? It is preferred that you apply using your savings account as most banks do not process IPO applications submitted using a current account. You need to check with your bank for more details. Can I apply for an IPO using my HUF’s account? You cannot apply via the Angel One app. However, you can apply using your HUF account through the physical ASBA process with your bank. Can I apply for an IPO using her account? The Angel One app doesn’t allow a minor to apply. Although, a minor can apply via physical ASBA process through your bank. Why didn’t my account get debited after applying for an IPO? As per the ASBA process, banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO. Once the shares are allotted to you, the amount will be debited from your bank account. If the shares are not allotted to you, the amount will be unblocked/released to your account on/before the UPI mandate expiry date. Note: Banks usually take 10-15 days to release your funds. If your funds are still blocked after 15 days please contact your bank. Can I modify my IPO bid? Yes, you can modify the lot size and UPI ID of your IPO bid after placing an order. Please note that if you have approved your UPI mandate request for the order and modified the order later, the entire IPO bid amount will be blocked in addition to the amount blocked for your original IPO bid. You will also receive another UPI mandate request for your modified bid. However, if you haven’t approved the original mandate request, no amount will be blocked for the original IPO bid. Why is my IPO application rejected? Few of the common reasons your IPO application is rejected You might have entered the wrong UPI ID or UPI PIN while approving the mandate Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill’s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack’s application will be rejected because Jill’s bank account used is not linked to the demat account of Jack Jill’s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack’s PAN When will my funds be blocked and unblocked? Your funds will be blocked once you approve the UPI mandate request for IPO. Your funds will be unblocked/released on or before the UPI mandate expiry date if the shares are not allotted through IPO. Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked/released post the mandate expiry date. How can I get a guaranteed IPO allotment? We would like to explain that Angel One is merely a platform to apply for IPO and has no control over its allotment. IPO allotment can never be guaranteed since, in case of over-subscription, the allotment is done via a lottery system. However, you can avoid application rejection by Applying from only 1 Demat account per PAN Applying at cut-off price Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill’s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack’s application will be rejected because Jill’s bank A/C used is not linked to the Demat A/c of Jack Jill’s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack’s PAN Where can I check my refund status in case of a rejected/non-allotted IPO application? Banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO. So, your funds will be released/unblocked on or before the UPI mandate expiry date. Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked or released post the mentioned date. Why didn’t I get my IPO allotment? Common reasons why you didn’t get the allotment are Non-Allotment – Allotment is done through lottery system because of over-subscription Rejection – Application can be rejected due to either of the following reasons: 1) Application received from multiple Demat accounts having the same PAN 2) Bank account Demat account, and UPI ID used for an application not mapped to the same PAN 3) Your bid price is lower than the final issue price Is tax applicable on profit from an IPO? Tax will be levied on your profit as per your tax bracket. When is the next IPO coming? Visit our website https://www. in/upcoming-IPO to get all information about forthcoming IPO’s. I have approved the mandate request, but the status on the Angel One app is still pending. What to do? Your UPI mandate request status on the Angel One app does not get updated in real-time. It will reflect shortly in your IPO order book. Can I withdraw/delete/cancel my IPO bid?

नीचे कुछ चीज़ें दी गई हैं जो आप कर सकते हैं: अपने भुगतान ऐप पर जाएं - अधिदेश अनुभाग पर जाएं और जांचें कि आपके पास खुला अधिदेश है या नहीं। यदि आपको कई अधिदेश प्राप्त हुए हैं तो आप अधिदेश विवरण में उल्लिखित एप्लिकेशन आईडी को एंजेल वन के एप्लिकेशन से ऑर्डर विवरण में उल्लिखित एप्लिकेशन आईडी के साथ सत्यापित कर सकते हैं। या सुनिश्चित करें कि आपका भुगतान ऐप अपडेट है। या यदि 6 घंटे से अधिक समय लग रहा है तो एंजेल वन के आवेदन से अपनी बोली रद्द करें और नई बोली लगाएं। आईपीओ अधिदेश अनुरोध को कैसे स्वीकृत करें? आपको अपने यूपीआई ऐप में आईपीओ मैंडेट अनुरोध को मंजूरी देनी होगी। मैं UPI मैंडेट अनुरोध को कब तक स्वीकृत कर सकता हूँ? लंबित शासनादेश अंतिम दिन शाम 5 बजे के बाद समाप्त हो जाएंगे। इसलिए उपयोगकर्ताओं को आईपीओ में भाग लेने के लिए अंतिम दिन शाम 5 बजे से पहले जनादेश स्वीकार करना चाहिए। आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने का शुल्क क्या है? एंजेल वन के साथ, आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने के लिए कोई शुल्क नहीं है। एंजेल वन ऐप का उपयोग करके एक एनआरआई आईपीओ के लिए कैसे आवेदन कर सकता है? एनआरआई एंजेल वन ऐप के माध्यम से आवेदन नहीं कर सकते हैं। हालाँकि, वे आपके बैंक में भौतिक एएसबीए (अवरुद्ध राशि द्वारा समर्थित एप्लिकेशन) प्रक्रिया के माध्यम से आवेदन कर सकते हैं। कट-ऑफ कीमत क्या है और मुझे कट-ऑफ कीमत पर आवेदन क्यों करना चाहिए? कट-ऑफ कीमत वह कीमत है जिस पर निवेशकों को आईपीओ के माध्यम से शेयर जारी किए जाते हैं। यह कीमत आवंटन चरण में सुनिश्चित की जाती है। जब कोई निवेशक कट-ऑफ कीमत पर आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करता है, तो इसका मतलब है कि वह इस कीमत पर बोली लगाने के लिए तैयार है। आदर्श परिदृश्य में, सभी खुदरा निवेशक अपने आवंटन की संभावना बढ़ाने के लिए कट-ऑफ कीमत पर बोली लगाते हैं। क्या मैं आवेदन करने के लिए ऐसे बैंक खाते का उपयोग कर सकता हूं जो एंजेल वन से लिंक नहीं है? आप किसी अन्य बैंक खाते का उपयोग करके आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन कर सकते हैं, बशर्ते खाता निवेशक के नाम पर हो। क्या मैं अपने बैंक के चालू खाते का उपयोग करके आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन कर सकता हूँ? यह बेहतर है कि आप अपने बचत खाते का उपयोग करके आवेदन करें क्योंकि अधिकांश बैंक चालू खाते का उपयोग करके जमा किए गए आईपीओ आवेदनों पर कार्रवाई नहीं करते हैं। अधिक जानकारी के लिए आपको अपने बैंक से जांच करनी होगी। क्या मैं अपने एचयूएफ खाते का उपयोग करके आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन कर सकता हूं? आप एंजेल वन ऐप के माध्यम से आवेदन नहीं कर सकते। हालाँकि, आप अपने बैंक में भौतिक एएसबीए प्रक्रिया के माध्यम से अपने एचयूएफ खाते का उपयोग करके आवेदन कर सकते हैं। मेरी बेटी नाबालिग है. क्या मैं उसके खाते का उपयोग करके आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन कर सकता हूँ? एंजेल वन ऐप किसी नाबालिग को आवेदन करने की अनुमति नहीं देता है। हालाँकि, एक नाबालिग आपके बैंक के माध्यम से भौतिक एएसबीए प्रक्रिया के माध्यम से आवेदन कर सकता है। आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने के बाद मेरे खाते से डेबिट क्यों नहीं हुआ? एएसबीए प्रक्रिया के अनुसार, जब आप आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करते हैं तो बैंक आपके पैसे को रोक/रोक लेंगे। एक बार जब आपको शेयर आवंटित हो जाएंगे, तो राशि आपके बैंक खाते से काट ली जाएगी। यदि आपको शेयर आवंटित नहीं किए गए हैं, तो राशि यूपीआई जनादेश की समाप्ति तिथि पर/उससे पहले आपके खाते में अनब्लॉक/जारी कर दी जाएगी। ध्यान दें: बैंक आमतौर पर आपकी धनराशि जारी करने में 10-15 दिन का समय लेते हैं। यदि आपका धन 15 दिनों के बाद भी अवरुद्ध है तो कृपया अपने बैंक से संपर्क करें। क्या मैं अपनी आईपीओ बोली संशोधित कर सकता हूँ? हां, आप ऑर्डर देने के बाद अपनी आईपीओ बोली के लॉट साइज और यूपीआई आईडी को संशोधित कर सकते हैं। कृपया ध्यान दें कि यदि आपने ऑर्डर के लिए अपने यूपीआई मैंडेट अनुरोध को मंजूरी दे दी है और बाद में ऑर्डर को संशोधित किया है, तो आपकी मूल आईपीओ बोली के लिए अवरुद्ध राशि के अलावा पूरी आईपीओ बोली राशि अवरुद्ध कर दी जाएगी। आपको अपनी संशोधित बोली के लिए एक और UPI मैंडेट अनुरोध भी प्राप्त होगा। हालाँकि, यदि आपने मूल अधिदेश अनुरोध को मंजूरी नहीं दी है, तो मूल आईपीओ बोली के लिए कोई भी राशि अवरुद्ध नहीं की जाएगी। मेरा आईपीओ आवेदन क्यों खारिज कर दिया गया है? आपके आईपीओ आवेदन खारिज होने के कुछ सामान्य कारण हो सकता है कि आपने अधिदेश स्वीकृत करते समय गलत UPI आईडी या UPI पिन दर्ज कर दिया हो यह सुनिश्चित करना कि बैंक खाता, डीमैट खाता और यूपीआई आईडी एक ही पैन पर मैप किए गए हैं उदाहरण के लिए: जैक अपने डीमैट खाते से आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने के लिए जिल की यूपीआई आईडी का उपयोग कर रहा है। ऐसे में जैक का आवेदन इसलिए खारिज कर दिया जायेगा जिल का इस्तेमाल किया गया बैंक खाता जैक के डीमैट खाते से जुड़ा नहीं है जिल की इस्तेमाल की गई यूपीआई आईडी जैक के पैन से जुड़ी नहीं है मेरे फंड कब ब्लॉक और अनब्लॉक होंगे? आईपीओ के लिए यूपीआई मैंडेट अनुरोध को मंजूरी मिलते ही आपका फंड ब्लॉक कर दिया जाएगा। यदि आईपीओ के माध्यम से शेयर आवंटित नहीं किए जाते हैं तो आपका फंड यूपीआई जनादेश की समाप्ति तिथि पर या उससे पहले अनब्लॉक/रिलीज़ कर दिया जाएगा। यदि आदेश की समाप्ति तिथि के बाद धनराशि अनब्लॉक/रिलीज़ नहीं होती है तो कृपया अपने बैंक से संपर्क करें। मैं गारंटीकृत आईपीओ आवंटन कैसे प्राप्त कर सकता हूं? हम यह समझाना चाहेंगे कि एंजेल वन केवल आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने का एक मंच है और इसके आवंटन पर इसका कोई नियंत्रण नहीं है। आईपीओ आवंटन की कभी भी गारंटी नहीं दी जा सकती, क्योंकि अधिक अभिदान की स्थिति में आवंटन लॉटरी प्रणाली के माध्यम से किया जाता है। हालाँकि, आप आवेदन अस्वीकृति से बच सकते हैं प्रति पैन केवल 1 डीमैट खाते से आवेदन करना कट-ऑफ मूल्य पर आवेदन करना यह सुनिश्चित करना कि बैंक खाता, डीमैट खाता और यूपीआई आईडी एक ही पैन पर मैप किए गए हैं उदाहरण के लिए: जैक अपने डीमैट खाते से आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने के लिए जिल की यूपीआई आईडी का उपयोग कर रहा है। ऐसे में जैक का आवेदन इसलिए खारिज कर दिया जायेगा जिल का उपयोग किया गया बैंक ए/सी जैक के डीमैट खाते से लिंक नहीं है जिल की इस्तेमाल की गई यूपीआई आईडी जैक के पैन से जुड़ी नहीं है अस्वीकृत/गैर-आवंटित आईपीओ आवेदन के मामले में मैं अपनी रिफंड स्थिति कहां देख सकता हूं? जब आप आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करेंगे तो बैंक आपके पैसे को रोक लेंगे/अवरुद्ध कर देंगे। तो, आपका फंड UPI मैंडेट की समाप्ति तिथि पर या उससे पहले जारी/अनब्लॉक कर दिया जाएगा। यदि उल्लिखित तिथि के बाद धनराशि अनब्लॉक या जारी नहीं की जाती है तो कृपया अपने बैंक से संपर्क करें। मुझे अपना आईपीओ आवंटन क्यों नहीं मिला? आपको आवंटन न मिलने के सामान्य कारण ये हैं गैर-आबंटन - अधिक अभिदान के कारण आवंटन लॉटरी प्रणाली के माध्यम से किया जाता है अस्वीकृति - निम्नलिखित में से किसी भी कारण से आवेदन अस्वीकार किया जा सकता है: 1) एक ही पैन वाले कई डीमैट खातों से प्राप्त आवेदन 2) बैंक खाता, डीमैट खाता, और यूपीआई आईडी का उपयोग ऐसे एप्लिकेशन के लिए किया जाता है जो समान पैन से मैप नहीं किया गया हो 3) आपकी बोली मूल्य अंतिम निर्गम मूल्य से कम है क्या आईपीओ से लाभ पर कर लागू होता है? आपके कर दायरे के अनुसार आपके लाभ पर कर लगाया जाएगा। अगला आईपीओ कब आ रहा है? आगामी आईपीओ के बारे में सभी जानकारी प्राप्त करने के लिए हमारी वेबसाइट https://www. in/upcoming-आईपीओ पर जाएं। मैंने अधिदेश अनुरोध को मंजूरी दे दी है, लेकिन एंजेल वन ऐप पर स्थिति अभी भी लंबित है। क्या करें? एंजेल वन ऐप पर आपकी यूपीआई मैंडेट अनुरोध स्थिति वास्तविक समय में अपडेट नहीं होती है। यह शीघ्र ही आपके आईपीओ ऑर्डर बुक में दिखाई देगा। क्या मैं अपनी आईपीओ बोली वापस ले/हटा/रद्द कर सकता हूँ? एंजेल वन ऐप में आईपीओ आवेदन प्रक्रिया के लिए, आवेदन वापस लेना, हटाना और रद्द करना एक ही बात है। अपना आईपीओ आवेदन वापस लेने/रद्द करने के लिए नीचे दिए गए पथ का अनुसरण करें होम पेज पर आईपीओ पर टैप करें आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें और उस आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें जिसे आप रद्द करना चाहते हैं अपना आईपीओ ऑर्डर रद्द करने के लिए रद्द करें और पुष्टि करें पर टैप करें मैं अपने आईपीओ आवेदन की स्थिति कैसे जांच सकता हूं? अपने आईपीओ आवेदन की स्थिति जांचने के लिए नीचे दिए गए पथ का अनुसरण करें होम पेज पर आईपीओ पर टैप करें आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें और उस आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें जिसके लिए आप आवेदन की स्थिति जांचना चाहते हैं यहां से आपके आईपीओ आवेदन की स्थिति दिखाई देगी आईपीओ आवंटन स्थिति की जांच कहां करें? अपनी सदस्यता स्थिति जांचने के लिए नीचे दिए गए पथ का अनुसरण करें होम पेज पर आईपीओ पर टैप करें आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें और उस आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें जिसके लिए आप सदस्यता स्थिति की जांच करना चाहते हैं आपकी आईपीओ सदस्यता स्थिति यहां दिखाई देगी क्या मैं आईपीओ के लिए एकाधिक आवेदन जमा कर सकता हूँ? प्रति पैन केवल 1 आवेदन की अनुशंसा की जाती है। यदि आप एक ही पैन का उपयोग करके विभिन्न प्लेटफार्मों के माध्यम से आवेदन करते हैं, तो भी आपका आवेदन खारिज कर दिया जाएगा और आपको आईपीओ आवंटन नहीं मिलेगा। हालाँकि, आप अलग-अलग पैन से जुड़े अलग-अलग खाते के साथ आवेदन करके आईपीओ आवंटन की संभावना बढ़ा सकते हैं। उदाहरण के लिए, आप अपने और अपने माता-पिता के डीमैट खाते से अलग-अलग आवेदन कर सकते हैं। ?

Trading & Surveillance व्यापार एवं निगरानी Risk Management – ASM & GSM निगरानी उपाय क्या है? बाजार निगरानी बाजारों की सुरक्षा और अखंडता सुनिश्चित करने में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाती है क्योंकि यह प्रतिभूति बाजारों में अपमानजनक, चालाकीपूर्ण या अवैध व्यापार प्रथाओं की रोकथाम और जांच की प्रक्रिया है। निगरानी उपाय नियामक निकायों और एक्सचेंजों द्वारा मूल्य और अस्थिरता की निगरानी करके और अंदरूनी व्यापार, फर्जी लेनदेन और अधिक जैसी भ्रामक गतिविधियों का पता लगाकर व्यापारियों और निवेशकों की सुरक्षा के लिए एक पहल है। एएसएम क्या है? सेबी (भारतीय प्रतिभूति और विनिमय बोर्ड) ने स्टॉक एक्सचेंजों के साथ मिलकर निवेशकों के हितों की रक्षा के लिए एक अतिरिक्त निगरानी उपाय या एएसएम शुरू किया है ताकि यह सुनिश्चित किया जा सके कि अप्रत्याशित मूल्य आंदोलनों जैसी कोई बाजार अटकलें या हेरफेर न हों। एनएसई द्वारा निर्दिष्ट मानदंडों के आधार पर निगरानी के लिए शेयरों को एएसएम के तहत वर्गीकृत किया गया है here. जीएसएम क्या है? जीएसएम या ग्रेडेड सर्विलांस मेज़र एक प्रणाली है जिसका उपयोग एनएसई और बीएसई जैसे भारतीय स्टॉक एक्सचेंजों द्वारा व्यापारियों/निवेशकों को सचेत करने और उन्हें जीएसएम के तहत वर्गीकृत कुछ प्रतिभूतियों में लेनदेन करते समय अतिरिक्त सतर्क रहने के लिए कहने के लिए किया जाता है। असामान्य मूल्य वृद्धि के कारण शेयरों को जीएसएम के तहत वर्गीकृत किया जा सकता है जो कंपनी के वित्तीय स्वास्थ्य से मेल नहीं खाते हैं, तरल नहीं हैं, नगण्य बाजार पूंजी है, और कम प्रदर्शन कर रहे हैं। ASM और GSM में क्या अंतर है? एएसएम ढांचे का मुख्य उद्देश्य स्टॉक की अस्थिरता को नियंत्रित करना है, जबकि जीएसएम का प्राथमिक उद्देश्य निवेशकों को इंट्राडे ट्रेडिंग की अनुमति न देकर खराब प्रदर्शन करने वाले शेयरों से बचाना है और उन प्रतिभूतियों से निपटने के दौरान उन्हें अतिरिक्त सतर्क रहने की सलाह देना है जिनमें असामान्य मूल्य में उतार-चढ़ाव हो रहा है।. ये दोनों ढाँचे अलग-अलग उद्देश्यों के साथ पेश किए गए हैं, लेकिन इनका मुख्य लक्ष्य व्यापारियों और निवेशकों की सुरक्षा करना है। ASM के अंतर्गत किसी शेयर को वर्गीकृत करने का आधार क्या है? सेबी और एक्सचेंज संयुक्त रूप से निम्नलिखित मापदंडों के आधार पर एएसएम के तहत प्रतिभूतियों को शॉर्टलिस्ट करने के लिए उद्देश्य मानदंड तय करते हैं: 1. मूल्य परिवर्तन के करीब-करीब 4. अद्वितीय पैन और पीई की संख्या किसी शेयर को GSM के अंतर्गत कब वर्गीकृत किया जाएगा? नीचे दिए गए संकेतों के आधार पर, नियामक निकाय और एक्सचेंज जीएसएम श्रेणी के तहत एक शेयर जोड़ने का निर्णय लेते हैं: 1. इलिक्विड सिक्योरिटीज के लिए आवधिक कॉल नीलामी सत्र 2. व्यापार के लिए व्यापार से प्रतिभूतियों की आवाजाही की आवधिक समीक्षा 3. लगातार शोर पैदा करने वाले 4. कीमत/मात्रा में उछाल के मामले में अफवाह सत्यापन और स्पष्टीकरण कोई शेयर एएसएम/जीएसएम से कब निकलेगा? एएसएम के मामले में हर 2 महीने और जीएसएम के मामले में हर तिमाही में स्टॉक एक्सचेंज द्वारा की गई समीक्षा के आधार पर सूची से अंदर और बाहर जा सकता है। एएसएम के तहत निगरानी उपाय क्या हैं? कृपया एएसएम के अंतर्गत विस्तृत निगरानी उपाय देखें here. ?

Verifying your mobile number helps us create a secure account for you, ensuring a smooth app experience and the safety of your account. Can I continue if the mobile number linked to my bank is different from the one registered with the app? No, your details, including your mobile number, must match those verified by our banking partner. A mismatch will result in your application being rejected by the bank. Why are permissions to send SMS and access phone state required? These permissions are needed to verify your mobile number by sending an SMS. Rest assured, these permissions are used solely for verification purposes. Can I link any SIM for FD purchase if I have a dual SIM phone? Yes, you can. However, we recommend using the SIM registered with your bank account for authentication. Can I retry the registration if it was not successful earlier? Yes, you can retry. Ensure you use the SIM linked to your bank account for authentication. Can I invest in FD if I do not have a PAN? No, currently, we only process fixed deposit requests for individuals with an active PAN. Why is my PAN not getting verified? For booking fixed deposits, we need to verify your PAN with the regulated authorities. If there is a mismatch, the booking cannot be completed. What should I do if the name shown against my PAN is incorrect and I can't update it? The name linked to your PAN should be accurate for successful identity verification and KYC purposes. Please update your name to match your PAN. Why is my Aadhar required? Aadhar is mandatory for identification and KYC setup for your account, necessary for processing your FD request. Do I need a physical copy of my Aadhar? No, a physical copy is not required. We use secure platforms like DigiLocker and CKYC for verifying your Aadhar and other documents. What is DigiLocker? DigiLocker is a government initiative under the Digital India project for storing and verifying documents like PAN card, driving license, Aadhar card, school marksheets, and insurance papers. What should I do if there's a name mismatch and I can't complete the step? For successful FD booking, the name on your Aadhar and PAN should match. Correct the details on either your PAN or Aadhar card and retry. How can I add a new address as my current address? Use the “add” button on the address choice screen to add an address that is not listed. What should I do if I can't change my permanent address? The address from your Aadhar is considered your permanent address. You may add or select your current address to proceed with the FD application. Can my permanent address be the same as my current address? Yes, you can select your permanent address as your current address if they are the same. Why is video KYC required? Video KYC is required to complete the KYC verification step as mandated by the RBI. What if I am not available during bank working hours? If you have made the payment, we will notify you when the bank officers are available. If video KYC is not completed within 3 days, your money will be refunded to your bank account. When can I complete the Video KYC? Video KYC is available from Monday to Saturday, 09:00 AM to 08:00 PM. We will notify you to complete the video KYC during these hours if pending. What if video KYC fails? You can retry during banking hours within 2 days of FD booking if your video KYC fails. How will I know the status of my video KYC? Your video KYC details are verified by bank officers, which may take up to 3 hours. Track the video KYC and FD confirmation status on the ‘My Investments’ tab. What should I do if I can't move to the next step and complete my KYC verification? Retry using the correct details. If it still doesn’t work, try again later. If the issue persists, raise a ticket with our support team for assistance. Why are details related to occupation, income, and family required for FD booking? These details are required by the bank to create your fixed deposit and ensure communication if needed. Why is my money deducted before video KYC? Your money is deducted before video KYC as it is the last step to verify your identity and book your FD. Your money is safe with the bank, and interest starts accumulating from the time of payment.

IPO आईपीओ ओएफएस सॉवरेन गोल्ड बांड (एसजीबी) स्टॉक एसआईपी मुझे अपनी यूपीआई आईडी कहां मिल सकती है? आम तौर पर, आप अपनी यूपीआई आईडी उस संबंधित ऐप के प्रोफ़ाइल अनुभाग में पा सकते हैं जिसका आप उपयोग कर रहे हैं। मेरे पास UPI आईडी नहीं है. क्या मैं आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन कर सकता हूँ? यदि आपके पास यूपीआई आईडी नहीं है, तो आप इसे एनपीसीआई सूची में शामिल किसी भी यूपीआई हैंडल से बना सकते हैं। वैकल्पिक रूप से, आप अपने बैंक में एएसबीए के माध्यम से या भौतिक रूप से आवेदन कर सकते हैं। मैं अपनी UPI आईडी कैसे बना सकता हूँ? BHIM ऐप से UPI आईडी बनाने के लिए आप नीचे दिए गए चरणों का पालन कर सकते हैं Google Pay/ PhonePe/BHIM ऐप डाउनलोड करें अपना मोबाइल नंबर सत्यापित करें पासकोड रजिस्टर करें (ऐप खोलने के लिए यह आवश्यक है) उपलब्ध विकल्पों में से अपना बैंक चुनें ऐप आपके बैंक विवरण प्राप्त करेगा यदि आपके पास एक से अधिक खाते हैं, तो वह खाता चुनें जिसे आप BHIM के साथ पंजीकृत करना चाहते हैं सुरक्षा के लिए एक UPI पिन सेट करें अब आप प्रोफाइल सेक्शन में अपनी यूपीआई आईडी चेक कर सकते हैं। मैं अपनी यूपीआई आईडी/हैंडल के जरिए आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन क्यों नहीं कर पा रहा हूं? आईपीओ अनुप्रयोगों के लिए, केवल एनपीसीआई द्वारा अनुमोदित यूपीआई आईडी/हैंडल की अनुमति है। यदि आप अपनी यूपीआई आईडी/हैंडल का उपयोग करके आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने में असमर्थ हैं, तो हम अनुशंसा करते हैं कि आप आईपीओ आवेदन के लिए यूपीआई सेवा प्रदान करने के लिए एनपीसीआई द्वारा अनुमोदित बैंकों/ऐप की सूची की जांच करें। आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करते समय मैं एंजेल वन ऐप में ड्रॉपडाउन में अपना यूपीआई हैंडल सूचीबद्ध क्यों नहीं देख सकता? यदि आप एंजेल वन ऐप में आईपीओ पेज पर ड्रॉपडाउन सूची में अपना यूपीआई हैंडल नहीं ढूंढ पाते हैं, तो इसका मतलब है कि आपका यूपीआई हैंडल आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने के लिए एनपीसीआई द्वारा अनुमोदित नहीं है। एनपीसीआई सूची में प्रदर्शित किसी भी इकाई के साथ वैकल्पिक यूपीआई आईडी का उपयोग करने या बनाने का प्रयास करें। ऑर्डर देने के बाद मुझे अपना यूपीआई मैंडेट अनुरोध कब प्राप्त होगा? नीचे कुछ चीज़ें दी गई हैं जो आप कर सकते हैं: अपने भुगतान ऐप पर जाएं - अधिदेश अनुभाग पर जाएं और जांचें कि आपके पास खुला अधिदेश है या नहीं। यदि आपको कई अधिदेश प्राप्त हुए हैं तो आप अधिदेश विवरण में उल्लिखित एप्लिकेशन आईडी को एंजेल वन के एप्लिकेशन से ऑर्डर विवरण में उल्लिखित एप्लिकेशन आईडी के साथ सत्यापित कर सकते हैं। या सुनिश्चित करें कि आपका भुगतान ऐप अपडेट है। या यदि 6 घंटे से अधिक समय लग रहा है तो एंजेल वन के आवेदन से अपनी बोली रद्द करें और नई बोली लगाएं। आईपीओ अधिदेश अनुरोध को कैसे स्वीकृत करें? आपको अपने यूपीआई ऐप में आईपीओ मैंडेट अनुरोध को मंजूरी देनी होगी। मैं UPI मैंडेट अनुरोध को कब तक स्वीकृत कर सकता हूँ? लंबित शासनादेश अंतिम दिन शाम 5 बजे के बाद समाप्त हो जाएंगे। इसलिए उपयोगकर्ताओं को आईपीओ में भाग लेने के लिए अंतिम दिन शाम 5 बजे से पहले जनादेश स्वीकार करना चाहिए। आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने का शुल्क क्या है? एंजेल वन के साथ, आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने के लिए कोई शुल्क नहीं है। एंजेल वन ऐप का उपयोग करके एक एनआरआई आईपीओ के लिए कैसे आवेदन कर सकता है? एनआरआई एंजेल वन ऐप के माध्यम से आवेदन नहीं कर सकते हैं। हालाँकि, वे आपके बैंक में भौतिक एएसबीए (अवरुद्ध राशि द्वारा समर्थित एप्लिकेशन) प्रक्रिया के माध्यम से आवेदन कर सकते हैं। कट-ऑफ कीमत क्या है और मुझे कट-ऑफ कीमत पर आवेदन क्यों करना चाहिए? कट-ऑफ कीमत वह कीमत है जिस पर निवेशकों को आईपीओ के माध्यम से शेयर जारी किए जाते हैं। यह कीमत आवंटन चरण में सुनिश्चित की जाती है। जब कोई निवेशक कट-ऑफ कीमत पर आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करता है, तो इसका मतलब है कि वह इस कीमत पर बोली लगाने के लिए तैयार है। आदर्श परिदृश्य में, सभी खुदरा निवेशक अपने आवंटन की संभावना बढ़ाने के लिए कट-ऑफ कीमत पर बोली लगाते हैं। क्या मैं आवेदन करने के लिए ऐसे बैंक खाते का उपयोग कर सकता हूं जो एंजेल वन से लिंक नहीं है? आप किसी अन्य बैंक खाते का उपयोग करके आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन कर सकते हैं, बशर्ते खाता निवेशक के नाम पर हो। क्या मैं अपने बैंक के चालू खाते का उपयोग करके आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन कर सकता हूँ? यह बेहतर है कि आप अपने बचत खाते का उपयोग करके आवेदन करें क्योंकि अधिकांश बैंक चालू खाते का उपयोग करके जमा किए गए आईपीओ आवेदनों पर कार्रवाई नहीं करते हैं। अधिक जानकारी के लिए आपको अपने बैंक से जांच करनी होगी। क्या मैं अपने एचयूएफ खाते का उपयोग करके आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन कर सकता हूं? आप एंजेल वन ऐप के माध्यम से आवेदन नहीं कर सकते। हालाँकि, आप अपने बैंक में भौतिक एएसबीए प्रक्रिया के माध्यम से अपने एचयूएफ खाते का उपयोग करके आवेदन कर सकते हैं। मेरी बेटी नाबालिग है. क्या मैं उसके खाते का उपयोग करके आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन कर सकता हूँ? एंजेल वन ऐप किसी नाबालिग को आवेदन करने की अनुमति नहीं देता है। हालाँकि, एक नाबालिग आपके बैंक के माध्यम से भौतिक एएसबीए प्रक्रिया के माध्यम से आवेदन कर सकता है। आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने के बाद मेरे खाते से डेबिट क्यों नहीं हुआ? एएसबीए प्रक्रिया के अनुसार, जब आप आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करते हैं तो बैंक आपके पैसे को रोक/रोक लेंगे। एक बार जब आपको शेयर आवंटित हो जाएंगे, तो राशि आपके बैंक खाते से काट ली जाएगी। यदि आपको शेयर आवंटित नहीं किए गए हैं, तो राशि यूपीआई जनादेश की समाप्ति तिथि पर/उससे पहले आपके खाते में अनब्लॉक/जारी कर दी जाएगी। ध्यान दें: बैंक आमतौर पर आपकी धनराशि जारी करने में 10-15 दिन का समय लेते हैं। यदि आपका धन 15 दिनों के बाद भी अवरुद्ध है तो कृपया अपने बैंक से संपर्क करें। क्या मैं अपनी आईपीओ बोली संशोधित कर सकता हूँ? हां, आप ऑर्डर देने के बाद अपनी आईपीओ बोली के लॉट साइज और यूपीआई आईडी को संशोधित कर सकते हैं। कृपया ध्यान दें कि यदि आपने ऑर्डर के लिए अपने यूपीआई मैंडेट अनुरोध को मंजूरी दे दी है और बाद में ऑर्डर को संशोधित किया है, तो आपकी मूल आईपीओ बोली के लिए अवरुद्ध राशि के अलावा पूरी आईपीओ बोली राशि अवरुद्ध कर दी जाएगी। आपको अपनी संशोधित बोली के लिए एक और UPI मैंडेट अनुरोध भी प्राप्त होगा। हालाँकि, यदि आपने मूल अधिदेश अनुरोध को मंजूरी नहीं दी है, तो मूल आईपीओ बोली के लिए कोई भी राशि अवरुद्ध नहीं की जाएगी। मेरा आईपीओ आवेदन क्यों खारिज कर दिया गया है? आपके आईपीओ आवेदन खारिज होने के कुछ सामान्य कारण हो सकता है कि आपने अधिदेश स्वीकृत करते समय गलत UPI आईडी या UPI पिन दर्ज कर दिया हो यह सुनिश्चित करना कि बैंक खाता, डीमैट खाता और यूपीआई आईडी एक ही पैन पर मैप किए गए हैं उदाहरण के लिए: जैक अपने डीमैट खाते से आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने के लिए जिल की यूपीआई आईडी का उपयोग कर रहा है। ऐसे में जैक का आवेदन इसलिए खारिज कर दिया जायेगा जिल का इस्तेमाल किया गया बैंक खाता जैक के डीमैट खाते से जुड़ा नहीं है जिल की इस्तेमाल की गई यूपीआई आईडी जैक के पैन से जुड़ी नहीं है मेरे फंड कब ब्लॉक और अनब्लॉक होंगे? आईपीओ के लिए यूपीआई मैंडेट अनुरोध को मंजूरी मिलते ही आपका फंड ब्लॉक कर दिया जाएगा। यदि आईपीओ के माध्यम से शेयर आवंटित नहीं किए जाते हैं तो आपका फंड यूपीआई जनादेश की समाप्ति तिथि पर या उससे पहले अनब्लॉक/रिलीज़ कर दिया जाएगा। यदि आदेश की समाप्ति तिथि के बाद धनराशि अनब्लॉक/रिलीज़ नहीं होती है तो कृपया अपने बैंक से संपर्क करें। मैं गारंटीकृत आईपीओ आवंटन कैसे प्राप्त कर सकता हूं? हम यह समझाना चाहेंगे कि एंजेल वन केवल आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने का एक मंच है और इसके आवंटन पर इसका कोई नियंत्रण नहीं है। आईपीओ आवंटन की कभी भी गारंटी नहीं दी जा सकती, क्योंकि अधिक अभिदान की स्थिति में आवंटन लॉटरी प्रणाली के माध्यम से किया जाता है। हालाँकि, आप आवेदन अस्वीकृति से बच सकते हैं प्रति पैन केवल 1 डीमैट खाते से आवेदन करना कट-ऑफ मूल्य पर आवेदन करना यह सुनिश्चित करना कि बैंक खाता, डीमैट खाता और यूपीआई आईडी एक ही पैन पर मैप किए गए हैं उदाहरण के लिए: जैक अपने डीमैट खाते से आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने के लिए जिल की यूपीआई आईडी का उपयोग कर रहा है। ऐसे में जैक का आवेदन इसलिए खारिज कर दिया जायेगा जिल का उपयोग किया गया बैंक ए/सी जैक के डीमैट खाते से लिंक नहीं है जिल की इस्तेमाल की गई यूपीआई आईडी जैक के पैन से जुड़ी नहीं है अस्वीकृत/गैर-आवंटित आईपीओ आवेदन के मामले में मैं अपनी रिफंड स्थिति कहां देख सकता हूं? जब आप आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करेंगे तो बैंक आपके पैसे को रोक लेंगे/अवरुद्ध कर देंगे। तो, आपका फंड UPI मैंडेट की समाप्ति तिथि पर या उससे पहले जारी/अनब्लॉक कर दिया जाएगा। यदि उल्लिखित तिथि के बाद धनराशि अनब्लॉक या जारी नहीं की जाती है तो कृपया अपने बैंक से संपर्क करें। मुझे अपना आईपीओ आवंटन क्यों नहीं मिला? आपको आवंटन न मिलने के सामान्य कारण ये हैं गैर-आबंटन - अधिक अभिदान के कारण आवंटन लॉटरी प्रणाली के माध्यम से किया जाता है अस्वीकृति - निम्नलिखित में से किसी भी कारण से आवेदन अस्वीकार किया जा सकता है: 1) एक ही पैन वाले कई डीमैट खातों से प्राप्त आवेदन 2) बैंक खाता, डीमैट खाता, और यूपीआई आईडी का उपयोग ऐसे एप्लिकेशन के लिए किया जाता है जो समान पैन से मैप नहीं किया गया हो 3) आपकी बोली मूल्य अंतिम निर्गम मूल्य से कम है क्या आईपीओ से लाभ पर कर लागू होता है? आपके कर दायरे के अनुसार आपके लाभ पर कर लगाया जाएगा। अगला आईपीओ कब आ रहा है? आगामी आईपीओ के बारे में सभी जानकारी प्राप्त करने के लिए हमारी वेबसाइट https://www. in/upcoming-आईपीओ पर जाएं। मैंने अधिदेश अनुरोध को मंजूरी दे दी है, लेकिन एंजेल वन ऐप पर स्थिति अभी भी लंबित है। क्या करें? एंजेल वन ऐप पर आपकी यूपीआई मैंडेट अनुरोध स्थिति वास्तविक समय में अपडेट नहीं होती है। यह शीघ्र ही आपके आईपीओ ऑर्डर बुक में दिखाई देगा। क्या मैं अपनी आईपीओ बोली वापस ले/हटा/रद्द कर सकता हूँ? एंजेल वन ऐप में आईपीओ आवेदन प्रक्रिया के लिए, आवेदन वापस लेना, हटाना और रद्द करना एक ही बात है। अपना आईपीओ आवेदन वापस लेने/रद्द करने के लिए नीचे दिए गए पथ का अनुसरण करें होम पेज पर आईपीओ पर टैप करें आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें और उस आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें जिसे आप रद्द करना चाहते हैं अपना आईपीओ ऑर्डर रद्द करने के लिए रद्द करें और पुष्टि करें पर टैप करें मैं अपने आईपीओ आवेदन की स्थिति कैसे जांच सकता हूं? अपने आईपीओ आवेदन की स्थिति जांचने के लिए नीचे दिए गए पथ का अनुसरण करें होम पेज पर आईपीओ पर टैप करें आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें और उस आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें जिसके लिए आप आवेदन की स्थिति जांचना चाहते हैं यहां से आपके आईपीओ आवेदन की स्थिति दिखाई देगी आईपीओ आवंटन स्थिति की जांच कहां करें? अपनी सदस्यता स्थिति जांचने के लिए नीचे दिए गए पथ का अनुसरण करें होम पेज पर आईपीओ पर टैप करें आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें और उस आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें जिसके लिए आप सदस्यता स्थिति की जांच करना चाहते हैं आपकी आईपीओ सदस्यता स्थिति यहां दिखाई देगी क्या मैं आईपीओ के लिए एकाधिक आवेदन जमा कर सकता हूँ? प्रति पैन केवल 1 आवेदन की अनुशंसा की जाती है। यदि आप एक ही पैन का उपयोग करके विभिन्न प्लेटफार्मों के माध्यम से आवेदन करते हैं, तो भी आपका आवेदन खारिज कर दिया जाएगा और आपको आईपीओ आवंटन नहीं मिलेगा। हालाँकि, आप अलग-अलग पैन से जुड़े अलग-अलग खाते के साथ आवेदन करके आईपीओ आवंटन की संभावना बढ़ा सकते हैं। उदाहरण के लिए, आप अपने और अपने माता-पिता के डीमैट खाते से अलग-अलग आवेदन कर सकते हैं। ?
